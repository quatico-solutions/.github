## We@Quatico 

“We develop digital products and services for companies on the web; fast, inexpensive and functionally so simple that they are useful for as many people as possible. We are the reliable partner for the digitization of innovative business ideas and complex analogue business processes.”

#### How we develop
We believe in quality, standards and modern architectures powered with and by open source software. We love the web, build our long-term relationships on microservices and actively date microfrontends. Since 2003 we have created brand new products, analyzed existing solutions and further developed projects over many years.

#### Our Culture
We value humanity, open feedback culture, trust, respect and appreciation. We focus on actual results and progress, foster automated processes and prefer long-term sustainability over short-term gains. We work as a team, tackling challenges together and creating digital products that stand out.

#### Open Source Community
We are an active member of [Hackergarten.net](https://www.hackergarten.net/). Come and code with us in our monthly [Meetup "Hackergarten Zurich"](https://www.meetup.com/hackergarten-zurich). We sponsor and contribute regularly to Open-Source events like [SoCraTes CH](https://socrates-ch.org/) and [Java User Group](https://www.jug.ch/).
